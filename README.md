# Resume Hosting and Formatting Guide

## Purpose

This README is a comprehensive guide for hosting and formatting your resume using Markdown and popular hosting platforms like GitHub Pages. It aims to provide practical steps while relating them to the key principles of technical communication, as outlined in Andrew Etter's book "Modern Technical Writing." In this guide, we will explore the practical process of leveraging Markdown, Markdown editors, and platforms like GitHub Pages and Jekyll to present resumes effectively.

## Prerequisites

1. Resume
   - Having a well-written and up-to-date resume is essential, and it is also easier to structure a well-crafted resume using Markdown.
2. Familiarity with Markdown
   - Markdown is a simple yet powerful markup language used for formatting text. Acquiring knowledge about Markdown is essential for effectively utilizing it to format your resume. Familiarity with Markdown syntax allows you to structure your resume content efficiently, enhancing readability and presentation. To aid in your understanding of Markdown or to provide guidance for beginners, I have included some Markdown resources in the "[More Resources](#more-resources)" section.
3. GitHub Account
   - Hosting a resume on GitHub requires a GitHub account. If you don't have one, sign up for a free account on [GitHub's website](https://github.com/). Having a GitHub account allows you to create repositories, upload files, and showcase your projects, including your resume.
4. Prepared Resume
   - Before proceeding, ensure you have your resume prepared in Markdown style.
5. GitHub Desktop (Optional)
   - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing your GitHub repositories. While not mandatory, in this guide, we will utilize GitHub Desktop for managing GitHub repositories and uploading your resume, but feel free to use the command line interface if you prefer.

## FAQs

**Why is Markdown better than a word processor?**

- **Simplicity**: Markdown offers a lightweight syntax that is simple to learn and use. It focuses on the content rather than complex formatting options, making it easier for writers to convey technical information clearly.
- **Version Control Compatibility**: Markdown files can be effectively managed using version control systems like Git. This approach aligns with the distributed version control system (DVCS) advocated by Etter in his book. By using Markdown, individuals can collaborate effectively, track changes, and manage revisions seamlessly within a version control environment.
- **Portability and Platform Independence**: Markdown documents are platform-independent and can be rendered into HTML, PDF, or other formats using static site generators. This makes Markdown ideal for creating documentation that can be accessed across various devices and platforms without compatibility issues.
